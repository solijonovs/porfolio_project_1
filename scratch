<h6 id="intro">    As a Passionate and driven Software Engineer with a B.A. in Computer & Information Science from Berea College (GPA: 3.8), recognized for academic excellence through the Dean’s List, Pugsley Mathematics Award, and participation in the CBYX Germany Exchange Program. Proficient in full-stack development, cloud infrastructure, and AI-driven solutions, with hands-on experience in JavaScript, Python, Angular, React, Azure, and AWS.

                <br><br>    Recently interned at The Boeing Company, I’ve contributed to scalable cloud applications, optimized UI performance, and built secure hybrid cloud systems. Previously, I led the development of college-wide tools at Berea College, reducing administrative workloads by 300+ hours. My projects include a collaborative filtering movie recommender system (Python/AI) and multi-cloud environment design, emphasizing scalability and security.

                <br><br>    Beyond coding, I thrive in leadership roles: growing the Google Developer’s Club by 35% as Technical Lead and fostering community as Asian Student Union Vice-President. Committed to lifelong learning, I aim to leverage technology to solve real-world challenges while mentoring future developers.
